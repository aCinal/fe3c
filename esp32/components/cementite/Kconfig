            Enable support for the Ed25519 curve.

        bool "Enable support for the Ed448 curve"

            Enable support for the Ed448 curve.

        bool "Use 4-isogeny of Ed448"

        help
            Enable performing the Ed448 computations on a 4-isogenous curve, which
            may increase performance, but amounts to using cofactored verification,
            which may lead to consensus issues where different implementations
            disagree on the validity of maliciously constructed signatures.

    config FE3C_SKIP_ZEROIZATION
        bool "Skip secret zeroization"
        depends on FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED25519 || FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED448
        default n
        help
            Disable zeroization of intermediate results on stack, which may marginally increase
            performance and reduce code footprint, but decreases security in systems where stack
            is shared with unsafe code, which may read data left behind by crypto operations.

    config FE3C_COMB_METHOD
        bool "Use comb method for scalar multiplication"
        depends on FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED25519 || FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED448
        default y
        help
            Enable comb method of scalar multiplication, which will increase data footprint,
            but will hugely increase performance.

    config FE3C_ED25519_SMALL_PRECOMPUTATION
        bool "Use smaller comb method precomputation tables on Ed25519"
        depends on FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED25519 && FE3C_COMB_METHOD

        help
            Minimize the size of Ed25519 precomputation tables when using the comb method.
            On ESP32 this seems to have no downside as it both reduces the memory
            footprint and increases performance.

    config FE3C_ED448_SMALL_PRECOMPUTATION
        bool "Use smaller comb method precomputation tables on Ed448"
        depends on FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED448 && FE3C_COMB_METHOD
        default n
        help
            Minimize the size of Ed448 precomputation tables when using the comb method,
            which decreases the memory footprint, but marginally decreases performance
            as well.

    config FE3C_PARALLEL_COMB_METHOD
        bool "Use parallel comb method"
        depends on FE3C_COMB_METHOD
        default n
        help
            Use a parallel implementation of the comb method which yields great performance benefits
            in systems with small CPU load.

        default y
        help
            Override common source files and definitions with target-specific ones, optimized
            for ESP32. This option is included only for development purposes as disabling it
            may decrease performance, increase binary size as well as create side-channel
            vulnerabilities.

    config FE3C_USE_SHA512_HARDWARE
        bool "Use SHA512 hardware acceleration when possible"
        depends on FE3C_PORT_OVERRIDES && FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED25519
        default n
        help
            Use SHA512 hardware acceleration when possible. This will significantly
            reduce stack usage and increase performance for large messages, but may
            cause blocking for some SoC variants.

    config FE3C_ENABLE_SANITY_CHECKS
        bool "Enable sanity checks"
        default n
        help
            Enable development assertions and sanity checks.
