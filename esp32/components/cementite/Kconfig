    config FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED25519
        bool "Enable support for the Ed25519 curve"
        default y
        help
            Enable support for the Ed25519 curve.

    config FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED448
        bool "Enable support for the Ed448 curve"
        default n
        help
            Enable support for the Ed448 curve.

    config FE3C_ED448_ISOGENY
        bool "Use 4-isogeny of Ed448"
        depends on FE3C_SUPPORT_CURVE_ED448
        default n
        help
            Enable performing the Ed448 computations on a 4-isogenous curve, which
            may increase performance, but amounts to using cofactored verification,
            which may lead to consensus issues where different implementations
            disagree on the validity of maliciously constructed signatures.

    config FE3C_SKIP_ZEROIZATION
        bool "Skip secret zeroization"
        default n
        help
            Disable zeroization of intermediate results on stack, which may marginally increase
            performance and reduce code footprint, but decreases security in systems where stack
            is shared with unsafe code, which may read data left behind by crypto operations.

    config FE3C_COMB_METHOD
        bool "Use comb method for scalar multiplication"
        default y
        help
            Enable comb method of scalar multiplication, which will increase data footprint,
            but will hugely increase performance.

    config FE3C_SMALL_PRECOMPUTATION
        bool "Use smaller precomputation tables for comb method"
        depends on FE3C_COMB_METHOD
        default y
        help
            Minimize the size of the precomputation tables when using the comb method.
            On ESP32 this seems to have no downside as it both reduces the memory
            footprint and increases performance.

    config FE3C_FAST_SQUARING
        bool "Use optimized squaring in the field"
        default y
        help
            Use a dedicated routine for squaring in the field instead of reusing the multiplication
            code.

    config FE3C_PORT_OVERRIDES
        bool "Use target-specific implementation"
        default y
        help
            Override common source files and definitions with target-specific ones, optimized
            for ESP32. This option is included only for development purposes as disabling it
            may decrease performance, increase binary size as well as create side-channel
            vulnerabilities.

    config FE3C_ENABLE_SANITY_CHECKS
        bool "Enable sanity checks"
        default n
        help
            Enable development assertions and sanity checks.
